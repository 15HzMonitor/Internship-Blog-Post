## Prerequisites

If you have not completed setting up your DShield Sensor and DShield SIEM, you must go back and do so before beginning this process, since you will need both to be working to connect them. <br>
This process assumes that you have completed both already. Please go back to the following documentations if you have not done so: <br>

1. [AWS Dshield Sensor Setup](./1.%20AWS%20DShield%20Sensor%20Setup.md)
2. [Setup Your DShield SIEM](./2.%20Setup%20Your%20DShield%20SIEM.md)

## Introduction and Objectives
In this section, you will be setting up FileBeat on your sensor, and connecting it to your DShield SIEM so that it sends logs to Elasticsearch. <br>
For more information about the FileBeat feature, you can visit the [elastic filebeat documentation page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-overview.html). <br>
You can also find Tutorials, Documentations, and other resources through the [elastic Getting Started page](https://www.elastic.co/getting-started/elasticsearch-relevance-engine-quick-start).<br>

## Estimated Time to Complete

Depending on your familiarity with ELK stacks and FileBeat, this should take <b>around 15-45 minutes</b> to complete. <br>
This section is specifically for installing a DShield SIEM, and is based on Guy Bruneau's and amalete11235's documentations.<br>
For additional documentation, troubleshooting, and support, you can find them at [Guy's GitHub page](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) and [amalete11235's GitHub Page](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md).

# Setup Process

## Install and configure Filebeat on your DShield Sensor and connect them to your ELK

*Commands from here and onwards have been copied and modified based on  [Guy's](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) documentation.*<br>

1. Download and install the Public Signing Key
    ``` bash
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

2. Install the `apt-transport-https` package
    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

3. Save the repository definitions to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
    ``` bash
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/oss-8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
    ```

4. Run `apt-get update` and install filebeat
    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install filebeat elastic-agent softflowd
    ```

5. Download the custom filebeat.yml file that will forward the logs the Elasticsearch
    ``` bash
    sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/main/filebeat.yml -o /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
    ```

6. Edit the filebeat.yml and change the IP address of the `output.logstash:` to match your external IP address:<br>
    ``` bash
    sudo vi /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
    ```
    ``` bash
    #==================== Output Event ====================
    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS:5044"]
    ```

<br>
<br>

## Troubleshoot and test Filebeat

1. Switch to root to test the Filebeat config<br>
<br>
    ```` bash
    ubuntu@hostname:~$ sudo su -

    root@hostname:~# filebeat test config
    Config OK

    root@hostname:~# filebeat test output
    logstash: [YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS]:5044...
      connection...
        parse host... OK
        dns lookup... OK
        addresses: [YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS]
        dial up... OK
      TLS... WARN secure connection disabled
      talk to server... OK

    root@hostname:~# exit
    logout

    ubuntu@hostname:~$
    ````

<br>
<br>

## Start filebeat, elastic-agent, and softflowd
<br>

```` bash
sudo systemctl enable filebeat
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl start filebeat
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl enable elastic-agent
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl enable softflowd
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl start softflowd
````
<br>
<br>

## Check the status of filebeat, elastic-agent, and softflowd
```` bash
sudo systemctl status filebeat
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl status elastic-agent
````
```` bash
sudo systemctl status softflowd
````
<br>
<br>

**Congratulations! You have connected your sensor to your SIEM! if you need additional troubleshooting guide, please refer to [Guy's documentation page](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main). <br> You can proceed to [hardening your DShield SIEM](4.%20Harden%20your%20DShield%20SIEM.md) or start your attack observations.**
