## Prerequisites

If you have not completed setting up your DShield Sensor and DShield SIEM, you must go back and do so before beginning this process, since you will need both to be working to connect them. <br>
This process assumes that you have completed both already. Please go back to the following documentations if you have not done so: <br>

1. [AWS Dshield Sensor Setup](./1.%20AWS%20DShield%20Sensor%20Setup.md)
2. [Setup Your DShield SIEM](./2.%20Setup%20Your%20DShield%20SIEM.md)

## Introduction and Objectives
In this section, you will be setting up FileBeat on your sensor, and connecting it to your DShield SIEM. <br>
For more information about the FileBeat feature, you can visit the [elastic filebeat documentation page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-overview.html). <br>
You can also find Tutorials, Documentations, and other resources through the [elastic Getting Started page](https://www.elastic.co/getting-started/elasticsearch-relevance-engine-quick-start).<br>

## Estimated Time to Complete

Depending on your familiarity with ELK stacks and FileBeat, this should take <b>around 15-45 minutes</b> to complete. <br>
This section is specifically for installing a DShield SIEM, and is based on Guy Bruneau's and amalete11235's documentations.<br>
For additional documentation, troubleshooting, and support, you can find them at [Guy's GitHub page](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) and [amalete11235's GitHub Page](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md).
