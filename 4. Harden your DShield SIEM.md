## Prerequisites

If you have not completed setting up your DShield Sensor and DShield SIEM and connecting them both through Filebeat, you must go back and do so before beginning this process since you will need all of them to be working. <br>
This process assumes that you have completed both already. Please go back to the following documentations if you have not done so: <br>

1. [AWS Dshield Sensor Setup](./1.%20AWS%20DShield%20Sensor%20Setup.md)
2. [Setup Your DShield SIEM](./2.%20Setup%20Your%20DShield%20SIEM.md)
3. [Configure Filebeat on DShield Sensor](./3.%20Configure%20Filebeat%20on%20DShield%20Sensor.md)

## Introduction and Objectives
In this section you will be configuring your DShield SIEM sensor to strengthen its security and prevent attackers from accessing it. <br>
