# AWS DShield Sensor Setup

## Introduction and Objectives
In this section, you will be creating an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server through an AWS EC2 Instance that is under the free compute tier. <br>
For more information about the AWS Free Tier feature, you can visit the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?p=ft&z=subnav&loc=1&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). <br>
You can also find Tutorials, Documentations, and other resources through this link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_ql_doc_do.

## Estimated Time to Complete

Depending on your familiarity with installing and seting up AWS Instances, Ubuntu, and Dshield sensors, this should take <b>around 15-45 minutes</b>. <br>
This section is specifically for installing a DShield sensor through AWS, and is based on Dr. Johannes Ullrich's documentation.
For other ways to install a DShield sensor, you can find them on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield/tree/main/docs/install-instructions).

# Setup Process

### Jump To:
[Sign up For An AWS Account](#sign-up-for-an-aws-account-1) <br>
[Setup EC2 Instance](#setup-ec2-instance-1) <br>
[Install and Setup DShield Sensor](#install--setup-dshield-sensor) <br>

   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%206.png)

7. Click "Create new key pair" under the Key Pair (login) section. <br>
   Type in your preferred Key pair name. <br>
   Select RSA as the Key pair type. <br>
   Select your Private key file format. In this case I'm using OpenSSH, so I selected .pem.<br>
   Click "Create key pair". <br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%207a.png)<br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%207b.png)<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Your RSA key should automatically download. Move your key to a secure and accessible folder.<br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%207c.png)<br>

8. Leave the Network and Subnet section as a default under the Network Settings section. <br>
   Click "Create security group" under Firewall (security groups). <br>
   Check the "Allow SSH traffic from" box and select "Anywhere" for now. <br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%208.png)<br>

9. Put "30" on the Root volume under the Configure storage section. <br>
   You can ignore the "Advanced details" section. <br> 
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%209.png)<br>

10. Your summary should look like the one below. Click "Launch instance".<br>
    Once the instance has been created, click the instance number to take you back to the instances page of EC2. <br>
    <br>

    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20AWS%2011.png)<br>

11. Find your public IP IPv4 address, and take note of it. This is located under the "details" section when you click your instance.<br>
    <b><em>Note: the IP address here is different than what you will have, and will change everytime you stop and start the instance.</em></b><br>
    <br>

## Install & Setup DShield Sensor

1. Open your preferred shell, locate the location of your .pem RSA key, and SSH into your server. <br>
   ```
   ssh -i .\Downloads\dshieldsensorkey.pem ubuntu@3.133.143.216
   ```
   A prompt will ask you if you would like to continue, type 'yes'.<br>
   <br>
   This key is not known by any other names.<br>
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? <b>yes</b><br>
   <br>
2. Set hostname for your honeypot using:<br>
   ```
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "hostname"
   ```
   This will be usefull later for your SIEM<br>
   <br>

3. Update OS
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
   ```
   <br>

4. Install Python2, Python-pip, git [may be installed by default].<br>
   Refer to https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-22.04/ or use the following commands:<br>
   <br>
   <b>It is advisable to be in the home directory when carrying out the following commands. (cd ~)</b><br>
   <br>
   ```
   cd ~ && sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt install python-pip -y && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && sudo apt update && sudo apt install python2.7 -y  && sudo apt install git -y && curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py && sudo python2 get-pip.py && sudo python3 get-pip.py
   ```
   <br>
5. Create a folder called 'install' and go there, clone the dshield software from GitHub, and install. Follow the prompts to install DShield.<br>
   A video on how to install the honeypot can also be found on the [ISC page](https://isc.sans.edu/tools/honeypot/).<br>
   ```
   mkdir install
   cd install
   git clone https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield.git
   cd dshield/bin
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
6. Follow the prompts to install DShield. <br>
   You will need your email address and API key located on your Internet Storm Center (ISC) account on one of the prompts. <br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Setup%20DShield%20Sensor%205.png)<br>
   <br>
   The rest should just be default. <br>

7. Once you have installed the sensor, you can reboot your instance with the following command:<br>
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
   <br>

8. At this point, when you try to SSH into your server, it should say Connection timed out, even if you put port 12222 in it.<br>
   This is because you have not configured your firewall in AWS yet. Please proceed to configuring the EC2 security to fix this. <br>
   ```
   ssh -i .\Downloads\dshieldsensorkey.pem ubuntu@3.133.143.216 -p 12222
   ```


## Configure EC2 Security

1. On your instance page, select your DShield Sensor instance, click the Security tab, and click the security group assigned to it. <br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/EC2%20Security%201.png)

2. Select the "Inbound rules" tab and click "Edit inbound rules" on the Security Groups page.<br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/EC2%20Security%202.png)
   
   
3. Change the existing inbound SSH rule from "Type" to "Custom TCP"<br>
   Port range to 12222<br>
   Source to "My IP"<br>
   Click "Save rules"<br>
   <br>
   ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/EC2%20Security%203.png)

4. Select "Add rule", with the settings "Type"as "All traffic" and  "Source" as "Anywhere".<br>
   This exposes your sensor to the world and allows all internet traffic to hit the honeypot.<br>
   <br>
