# AWS DShield Sensor Setup

## Introduction and Objectives
In this section, you will be creating an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server through an AWS EC2 Instance that is under the free compute tier. <br>
For more information about the AWS Free Tier feature, you can visit the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?p=ft&z=subnav&loc=1&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). <br>
You can also find Tutorials, Documentations, and other resources through this link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_ql_doc_do.

## Estimated Time to Complete

Depending on your familiarity with installing and seting up AWS Instances, Ubuntu, and Dshield sensors, this should take <b>around 15-45 minutes</b>. <br>
This section is specifically for installing a DShield sensor through AWS, and is based on Dr. Johannes Ullrich's documentation.
For other ways to install a DShield sensor, you can find them on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield/tree/main/docs/install-instructions).
