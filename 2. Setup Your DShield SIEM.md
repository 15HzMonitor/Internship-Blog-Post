## Introduction and Objectives
In this section, you will be downloading Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server ISO, installing it to a machine, and installing your DShield SIEM into it. <br>
For more information about the Ubuntu OS, you can visit the [Ubuntu documentation page](https://help.ubuntu.com/?_ga=2.147379583.939059596.1731879815-467453869.1731770441). <br>
You can also find more Linux tutorials and other resources through the [Learn Linux TV page](https://www.learnlinux.tv/).

## Estimated Time to Complete

Depending on your familiarity with imaging and installing OS on computers, DBANs, troubleshooting, and ELK stack setups, this should take <b>around 2 to 4 hours</b> to complete. <br>
This section is specifically for installing a DShield SIEM, and is based on Guy Bruneau's and amalete11235's documentations.<br>
For additional documentation, troubleshooting, and support, you can find them at [Guy's GitHub page](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) and [amalete11235's GitHub Page](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md).

# Setup Process

## (Option) Wipe Your Hard Drive - Parted Magic or DBAN
As the title says, this will be optional. You may skip this step and go directly to the next step if you do not want to wipe your hard drive beforehand.<br>
<em><b>Disclaimer: you will be liable for your own data loss, so please back up any valuable files before you wipe your hard drives or before you install a new OS.</b></em><br>

#### Parted Magic

1. Install Parted Magic into a USB boot drive - https://partedmagic.com/creating-liveusb/
2. Booting the USB Boot Drive to your PC - https://partedmagic.com/booting/
3. Wipe your HD/SSD through Secure Erase - https://partedmagic.com/secure-erase/ <br>
- You can watch another video from this user's [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyMRabOO2Uc) as well.<br>

#### DBAN

1. Installing DBAN into a USB boot drive and using DBAN to wipe your HD/SSD can be found on this user's [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ0dfR56edE).<br>

## Download and Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server to a Physical Machine

1. [Create a bootable USB](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) <br>
2. Boot the installer <br>
   - There should be an on-screen message when the computer starts telling you what key to press for settings or a boot menu. <br>
  Depending on the manufacturer, this could be Escape, F2, F10 or F12. <br>
  Simply restart your computer and hold down this key until the boot menu appears, then select the drive with the Ubuntu install media. - [Ubuntu Docs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/basic-installation#boot-the-installer)

3. Follow the installer screens until it says "Installation Complete!" and it prompts you to reboot. <br>
   If you need more assistance, Ubuntu provides documentation on their [installation guide page](https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html) that includes a [screen-by-screen guide](https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tutorial/screen-by-screen.html).

   - Additional tutorial videos can also be found here:<br>
     - [How To Prepare Bootable USB For Linux Through Rufus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvm0bIOBRCM&t=31s)<br>
     - [Install Ubuntu Server To a Physical Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2m52F0S2w8)

<em>Side tip: this would be the same process if you would like to use that repurposed machine as your DShield Sensor instead of a SIEM... All you need to do now is to clone the git, etc. You're welcome! :D</em>

## (Option) Download and Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server to a Virtual Machine
This is an optional part if you would like to use a VM rather than a physical machine. You may skip this step and proceed to the next step if it doesn't apply to you.<br>
For this one I will be using VMWare as an example, but if you prefer a different hypervisor, you can search for them on YouTube, Google, or the hypervisor's website for documentations.<br>

- Refer on this YouTube video on how to [install Ubuntu Server on VMWare (Ubuntu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df6xqFsz-GY).<br>
- Refer on this YouTube video on how to [install Ubuntu Server on VMWare (Windows 11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeOpluw4ZI).<br>

For additional documentations on how to configure and install a virtual machine through VMWare, visit the [Workstation Pro documentation page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/17/com.vmware.ws.using.doc/GUID-22C31FB5-01A3-4E16-8B77-3FD5A0728C04.html)

## Build a Docker Partition
*Commands have been copied and modified from [Guy's](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) and [amalete11235's](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md) documentations.*<br>

Once you have installed the OS and your machine is connected to a network, you can SSH into it from your main computer.<br>

1. Find the assigned IP address of your server and SSH into it from your main computer.
    ``` bash
    dshieldsiem@dshieldsiem:~$ hostname -I
    ```
    ```
    PS C:\Users\admin> ssh dshieldsiem@255.255.255.255
    ```
   - where your 'dshieldsiem' will be the username you created upon installation and your server IP will replace 255.255.255.255

2. Switch to root
    ``` bash
    sudo su -
    ```

3. Find your extra storage device. For me, it's the one with `931.5G` named `sda`
    ``` bash 
    root@dshieldsiem:~# lsblk
    NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    sda           8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
    └─sda1        8:1    0 931.5G  0 part 
    ```

4. You will need to delete any existing partitions. **Don't delete a partition that you don't want to lose!** Create a new partition using all of the default values. Use your full disk, unless you have special plans.
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# cfdisk /dev/sda
    ```

    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Partition%201.png) <br>

    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Partition%202.png) <br>

    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Partition%203.png) <br>

    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Partition%204.png) <br>

5. Install lvm2. 
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# apt install lvm2
    ```
6. Initialize the physical volume for use with LVM, then create a new volume group and a logical volume.
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# pvcreate /dev/sda1
      Physical volume "/dev/sda1" successfully created.

    root@dshieldsiem:~# vgcreate vg01 /dev/sda1
      Volume group "vg01" successfully created

    root@dshieldsiem:~# vgdisplay vg01 
      --- Volume group ---
      VG Name               vg01
      System ID             
      Format                lvm2
      Metadata Areas        1
      Metadata Sequence No  1
      VG Access             read/write
      VG Status             resizable
    ```

- *the `--size` in this command will vary on how much GBs you want to allocate in your partition*
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# lvcreate -n lv01 --size 931G vg01 
      Logical volume "lv01" created.

    root@dshieldsiem:~# lvdisplay /dev/vg01/lv01 
      --- Logical volume ---
      LV Path                /dev/vg01/lv01
      LV Name                lv01
      VG Name                vg01
    ```

7. Create an xfs
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# sudo apt install xfsprogs 

    root@dshieldsiem:~# sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vg01/lv01 

    root@dshieldsiem:~# echo "/dev/vg01/lv01 /var/lib/docker xfs defaults,noatime,nosuid 0 0" >> /etc/fstab 

    root@dshieldsiem:~# mkdir -p /var/lib/docker

    root@dshieldsiem:~# mount /dev/vg01/lv01 /var/lib/docker/

    root@dshieldsiem:~# df -h
    /dev/mapper/vg01-lv01  931G  6.6G  925G   1% /var/lib/docker
    ```

## Enable cgroup - *Important!*

 This step solves an error during the docker portion: `Your kernel does not support memory limit capabilities or the cgroup is not mounted. Limitation discarded.` *If you do not follow this step for your machine, expect critically degraded performance from the SIEM's dashboard.* 

1. Append this code to the first line in `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` to enable cgroup for memory. This will allow docker to manage the different containers' memory without crashing.
    ``` bash
    root@dshieldsiem:~# echo -n "cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1" >> /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    ```
2. `sudo reboot`, and SSH back in when it's finished.

## Install Docker
*Commands have been copied and modified from [Guy's](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main), [amalete11235's](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md), and [fkadriver's](https://github.com/fkadriver/Dshield-ELK/blob/main/README.md) documentations.*<br>

1. Update and install repositories
    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg network-manager txt2html
    ```

2. Add Docker's GPG key
    ```bash
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    ```

3. Set up the repository
    ``` bash
    echo \
    "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

4. Update and upgrade the apt package index
    ``` bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```
      - If there are updates applied, `sudo reboot`

5. Install the Docker engine, jq, and pip.
    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get install -y jq docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin pip
    ```

6. Enable Docker
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    ```

### Checkpoint
  *Stop here if you want to take a break and continue the installation at a later time. You're almost there! We just have to do the actual ELK stack setup now. <br>
  Since your machine is not really hardened yet, I suggest turning it off for now so that it's not exposed to the internet. <br>
  Turn it back on and SSH once you're ready to move on to the next steps :).* <br>

## Install and Configure Dshield ELK
*Commands from here and onwards have been copied and modified based on  [Guy's](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main) and [amalete11235's](https://github.com/amelete11235/homelab/blob/main/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM/Installing%20DShield%20SIEM%20on%20a%20Raspberry%20Pi%205%20-%208%20GB%20RAM.md) documentations.*<br>


1. Clone the SIEM's repository, update the `cowrie-setup.sh` permissions, and create the 'scripts' folder. <br>
   Move the files `parsing_tty.sh` `rename_arkime_pcap.sh` to the scripts folder and update permissions. <br>
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM.git

    chmod 754 ~/DShield-SIEM/scripts/cowrie-setup.sh

    mkdir scripts

    mv DShield-SIEM/AddOnScripts/parsing_tty.sh scripts

    mv DShield-SIEM/AddOnScripts/rename_arkime_pcap.sh scripts

    chmod 754 scripts/*.sh
    ```

2. Update the `.env` file to configure the stack to your environment:
    ``` bash
    cd ~/DShield-SIEM

    vi .env
    ```
    Important variables to configure, and passwords to change:
      - `ELASTIC_PASSWORD=student`
      - `KIBANA_PASSWORD=changeme`
      - `HOSTNAME="dshieldsiem"`
      - `IPADDRESS="192.168.0.2"` (the IP address of your SIEM)

3. (Optional) Change the default nameservers in logstash configs. `nameserver => [ "9.9.9.9", "1.1.1.1" ]`
    ``` bash
    cd logstash/pipeline

    vi logstash-200-filter-cowrie.conf                          

    vi logstash-201-filter-iptables.conf

    vi logstash-202-filter-cowrie-webhoneypot.conf
    ```

4.  Execute docker compose to build the ELK server applications.
    ``` bash
    cd ~/DShield-SIEM

    sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/ELK%201.png)<br>

5. Enable `docker.service` and check to see if it's running.
    ``` bash
    sudo systemctl enable docker.service

    sudo systemctl start docker.service

    sudo systemctl status docker.service
    ```

6. Use `sudo docker container ls` to check that the services are running.<br>
   <br>
![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/ELK%202.png)<br>

7. Check to make sure the ELK services are listening on ports 9200, 8220, 5601, and 5044.
    ``` bash
    sudo netstat -tulnp | grep '9200\|8220\|5601\|5044'
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9200            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5044            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8220            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5601            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp6       0      0 :::9200                 :::*                    LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp6       0      0 :::5044                 :::*                    LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp6       0      0 :::8220                 :::*                    LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    tcp6       0      0 :::5601                 :::*                    LISTEN      1111/gdocker-proxy   
    ```


## Login to Kibana and configure the dashboard

1. Open a web browser, go to `https://<YOUR SIEM's IP>:5601` and bypass certificate warnings.

2. Login using the credentials that you configured in [Install and Configure Dshield ELK Step 2](#install-and-configure-dshield-elk)<br>
  ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Login%201.png)<br>

3. Go to *Management > Stack Monitoring > **Or, set up with self monitoring**<br>
  ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Login%202.png)<br>

## Configure elastic-agent
1. Go to *Management > Fleet > Settings > Outputs > Actions column > Pencil Icon*<br>
    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%201.png)<br>
    ![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%202.png)<br>


2. In another window, SSH into your Pi, and get the SHA256 fingerprint of the dshield ELK cert:
    ``` bash 
    ssh dshieldsiem@192.168.0.2

    sudo cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/dshield-elk_certs/_data/ca/ca.crt /tmp

    sudo openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout -in /tmp/ca.crt | awk -F"=" {' print $2 '} | sed s/://g
    ```

   - The output should look like this: `0D9A25F4C147EB3A496253525DF6F039CF3C19776E64A1F77CEFCCD08B76BC61`


3. In the SSH session, print out a formatted version of the cert. Notice that each line in the output has been indented by 4 spaces. This will be pasted into the advanced YAML configuration along with some YAML syntax.
    ``` bash
    sudo cat /tmp/ca.crt | sed -r 's/(.*)/    \1/g'
    ```
   - Output example:
    ```

5. Make the following config changes, then click *Save and apply settings,* and then *Save and deploy changes* <br>
   - Change the *Hosts* field to `http://es01:9200` <br>
   - Paste the SHA-256 fingerprint you generated in the terminal into the *Elasticsearch CA trusted fingerprint (optional)* field <br>
   - Paste your version of the above cert + YAML syntax into the *Edit output* form that you opened in the elastic web console <br>

6. In the same *Management > Fleet > Settings* window, generate a fleet server policy and add a fleet server.<br>
![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%204.png)

7. Copy the code in the RPM tab into a text editor. After copying you must add an `s` to `http` as shown in the image below. Don't copy the top two lines.<br>
![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%205.png)

   - Copy these next lines and add them to the end of the `elastic-agent enroll` command (before the systemctl commands). Don't forget to add a backslash after `--fleet-server-port=8220`
      ``` bash
        --url=https://fleet-server:8220\
        --certificate-authorities=/certs/ca/ca.crt \  
        --fleet-server-es-ca=/certs/es01/es01.crt \
        --insecure
      ```


8.  Execute a shell into your fleet-server Docker container using `sudo docker exec -ti fleet-server bash` and then run the following commands to check your agent, there may be errors:
    ``` bash
    elastic-agent status
    ```


9. Paste your carefully edited commands from the text editor into the shell. This step can be very "touchy". If you make little mistakes, you can crash your Pi, but if everything is followed correctly, there won't be any problems. <br>

![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%207.png)<br>

10.   Check your `elastic-agent` again, and it should be healthy.<br>
![](./Images%20and%20Screenshots/Elastic%20Agent%208.png)


11.   Exit the `fleet-server`

12.   Back in the web console, go to the *Agents* tab and refresh your browser page if there's no agents present. You will see the `fleet-server`. Then click on the *Agent Policies* tab.<br>

## Integrate Threat Intelligence
*Note: These installations can take a long time. You can save yourself some pain if you properly add swap, as shown earlier. You may prefer to customize those settings yourself.*<br>
If you continue having problems, run `sudo docker compose stop` and `sudo docker compose start`,  or see [Guy's troubleshooting tips](https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/blob/main/Troubleshooting/docker_useful_commands..md)<br>
You will need your AlienVault OTX account copy/paste your API key on one of the integrations. You can sign up on the [AlienVault OTX sign up page](https://otx.alienvault.com/).


1. From *Agent Policies* click on *Fleet Server Policy > Add Integration. <br>
